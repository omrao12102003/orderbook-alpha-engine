# Order Book Alpha Signal Engine 

This project demonstrates how professional trading systems analyze **order book data** to generate BUY / SELL / HOLD signals.



---

## What is an Order Book?

An order book contains all active **buy orders** and **sell orders** in the market.

Example:

BIDS (Buyers)        ASKS (Sellers)
100.05 × 50          100.10 × 40
100.00 × 30          100.15 × 60

Price moves when **buying pressure** or **selling pressure** dominates.

## What This Project Does

1. Reads market events (orders & trades)
2. Builds a live limit order book
3. Measures buyer vs seller pressure
4. Generates BUY / SELL / HOLD signals

This project **does NOT place real trades**.  
It focuses only on **signal generation**

## Project Phases Overview

Market Events

Phase 1 — Event Model  
↓  
Phase 2 — Limit Order Book  
↓  
Phase 3 — Deterministic Replay  
↓  
Phase 4 — Alpha Signal Engine

## Phase 1 — Market Event Model

Each market action is represented as an **event**:

- ADD order
- MODIFY order
- CANCEL order
- TRADE execution

Every event contains:
- Timestamp (nanoseconds)
- Order ID
- Side (BUY / SELL)
- Price
- Quantity

This makes the system **deterministic and replayable**.

---

## Phase 2 — Limit Order Book

The order book stores all active buy and sell orders.

Features:
- Separate bid and ask sides
- Price-time priority (FIFO)
- Best bid / best ask queries
- Deterministic updates

This mimics how real exchanges work.

---

## Phase 3 — Deterministic Replay

Market events are replayed **one by one** in time order.

Why this matters:
- No look-ahead bias
- Same input → same output
- Easy debugging

---

## Phase 4 — Alpha Signal Engine

This phase generates trading signals using **market microstructure**.

### Signals Used

Order Book Imbalance (OBI):
OBI = (BidVolume − AskVolume) / (BidVolume + AskVolume)

Depth Imbalance:
Confirms buyer or seller dominance

Spread Penalty:
Large spreads reduce signal confidence

### Composite Alpha Formula

Alpha =
0.6 × OBI  
+ 0.3 × Depth Imbalance  
− 0.1 × Normalized Spread  

### Decision Rules

- Alpha ≥ +0.05 → BUY
- Alpha ≤ −0.05 → SELL
- Otherwise → HOLD

---

## Example Output

TS=100 | Alpha=0.032 | HOLD  
TS=200 | Alpha=0.061 | BUY  
TS=300 | Alpha=-0.071 | SELL
